* Introduction

The redo system has rapidly become central to my software development
activities, serving as the backbone of a larger system (exo) that is
described elsewhere.

The version of redo I'm using is a reimplementation in Erlang of a
system originally described by djb, and popularized by apenwarr.  The
version that I describe here is a generalization that can manage all
kinds of abstract state in addition to files in a file system, and is
written in Erlang, a language/runtime that is better suited for
integrating collections of services.

In summary, the basic ideas are:

- Files are too concrete.  There are many more kinds of abstract state
  for which one would like to manage the updates in a data-flow
  approach.

- Many "compilers" have significant startup time, and are thus better
  run as services with internal cache, as opposed to batch processing
  programs.

- Managing services is what Erlang is designed for.
